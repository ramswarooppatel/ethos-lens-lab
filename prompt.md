 Prompt:

Design a premium, dark-themed, responsive frontend UI for a web-based platform called EthosLens ‚Äî A Crowd-Sourced Ethical AI & Bias Observatory.
The platform enables users to upload AI models or datasets, analyze them for bias and fairness, and view community-driven audit reports.

üé® Design Aesthetic

Theme: Dark grayish base with soft white and muted cyan or electric blue accents.

Mood: Elegant, futuristic, research-grade, and trustworthy.

Lighting: Subtle glassmorphism with blurred panels and diffused white glows.

Typography: Use "Inter", "Space Grotesk", or "Satoshi" for a premium and tech-modern feel.

Icons: Use minimal line icons with a soft neon glow.

Microinteractions: Smooth hover transitions, card flips, and fade animations using Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions.

üß† UI Interaction Simulation

Implement local interactivity only (no backend).

Simulate uploads, chart data, and user posts with dummy JSON files or mock APIs.

Use React + Tailwind + Framer Motion for fluid animations.

Use Recharts or Chart.js for visual analytics components.

Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

‚ú® Expected Output

A visually stunning, futuristic dark UI that feels premium, data-centric, and ethical-by-design.
It should simulate a functional app locally (mock APIs, dummy data, state changes) while focusing on design perfection, microinteractions, and clarity.
Everything must look professional enough for a global AI ethics observatory demo.

Tagline to show subtly on footer:

USE LOCAL STORAGE

USE LOCAL STORAGE AND STIMULATE THE ENTIRE WORK FLOW AND ALSO ADD BUTTONS TO DIRECTLY INSERT DATA SO THE ANNSWER IS ALSO HARDCODED 

SO IT FEELS LIKE A FLOW AND VALID BUT ACTUALLY IT JUST STIMULATES

STIMULATES ALL THE THINGS AND ADD MORE FEATURES AND ENCHNACE THE FEATURED MAKE THEM MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND ALSO ENCHANCE THE UI AND ADD ADVANCED FEATURES
