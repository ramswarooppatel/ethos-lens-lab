Place premium/self-hosted font files here (for example: Klavika, Oliver).

Recommended files:
- .woff2 (recommended)
- .woff
- .ttf (fallback)

Naming suggestions used by the project (matching CSS @font-face rules in src/index.css):
- klavika-regular.woff2
- klavika-semibold.woff2
- oliver-regular.woff2
- oliver-semibold.woff2

License:
- Make sure you have the appropriate commercial license for any premium fonts.
- Do not commit licensed font files to public repositories unless your license allows it.

If you prefer to self-host Roboto as well, add `roboto-*.woff2` files and update the @font-face rules in `src/index.css` accordingly.
